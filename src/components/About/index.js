                        I am a programmer in progress and always wanting to learn more. I am currently enrolled at
                        the University of Utah coding Bootcamp. I have been programing in VB.net, C#, Autodesk
                        Inventor iLogic, and AutoCAD VisualLisp around 10 years. I love developing new website and
                        applications. When things don't work the way I would like, I love figuring out what is
                        wrong.

                        I have been working in the woodworking business since 2001. During that time, I have been
                        wearing a variety of hats as a drafter, Project Engineer, Project Manager, to a CAD Manager
                        my current position. I started programing custom command and automation to start out with.
                        Then moved into .net applications also intergrading SQL data manipulation.
